## Installation

To install run the following commands in the root folder.

```shell
yarn install
```

In order for the app to work, you would have to do a few more things.

First, create a new app in the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">discord developer portal</a>.
After you have made your app, you will have to head to the **Bot** tab, and there you will have your **token**.
Keep it safe, anyone with that can mess with your bot.

In order to run your own instance of the bot, you will have to create a _config.json_ file in the root folder. It must have the following structure.

```json
{
  "prefix": "!n",
  "token": "YourTokenHere"
}
```

You can change the prefix if you feel like it.

To serve a development build use the following command.

```shell
yarn dev
```
